# Akamai CLI for Diagnostic Tools

The Diagnostic Tools API allows you to diagnose many common problems Akamai customers experience when delivering content to their end users. It offers a programmatic alternative to many of the features available in the Luna Control Center, under the Resolve â‡’ Diagnostic Tools menu.

Should you miss something we *gladly accept patches* :)

CLI uses custom [Akamai API client](https://github.com/apiheat/go-edgegrid)

## Configuration & Installation

### Credentials

Set up your credential files as described in the [authorization](https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html) and [credentials](https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Conf_Client.html) sections of the getting started guide on developer.akamai.com.

Tools expect proper format of sections in edgerc file which example is shown below

*NOTE:* Default file location is *~/.edgerc*

```
[default]
client_secret = XXXXXXXXXXXX
host = XXXXXXXXXXXX
access_token = XXXXXXXXXXXX
client_token = XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

In order to change section which is being actively used you can

* change it via `--config parameter` of the tool itself
* change it via env variable `export AKAMAI_EDGERC_CONFIG=/Users/jsmitsh/.edgerc`

In order to change section which is being actively used you can

* change it via `--section parameter` of the tool itself
